# Learning ggplot2

We're learning ggplot2 It's going to be amazing. 

```{r}
# install and load tidyverse
#install.packages("tidyverse") # note on Windows use double quot

#load installed packages using  'library()'
library(tidyverse)

#National Parks in California
ca <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/ca.csv") 

#Acadia National Park
acadia <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/acadia.csv")

#Southeast US National Parks
se <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/se.csv")

#2016 Visitation for all Pacific West National Parks
visit_16 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/visit_16.csv")

#All Nationally designated sites in Massachusetts
mass <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/mass.csv")

```

start with California ('ca') dataset

```{r}
head(ca)
View(ca)
```

Plot visitation to all CA NAtional Parks over time

```{r}
ggplot(data = ca) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = ca) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors, color = park_name))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = ca) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors, color = park_name)) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Visitation",
       title = "California National Park Visitation") +
  theme_bw() + #this utilizes a different theme (dark and light)
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) #this removes legent title
```
 
Exercise 5.8 
 
```{r}
ggplot(data = se) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors, color = state)) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Visitation",
       title = "Visitation to National Parks in the Southest US") +
  theme_minimal() + #this utilizes a different theme (dark and light)
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, size = 14))
  
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
